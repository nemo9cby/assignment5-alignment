# CS336 Spring 2026 Assignment 5: Alignment

> 📚 **本 fork 附带一门交互式后训练入门课程**（每一步可验证，GPU 部分走 Modal，含 AI Lab 面试题集）：
> 从 [course/README.md](./course/README.md) 开始，随时用 `uv run python course/check.py` 查看进度。

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cs336_spring2026_assignment5_alignment.pdf](./cs336_spring2026_assignment5_alignment.pdf)

We will include a supplemental (and completely optional) assignment on safety alignment, instruction tuning, and RLHF at [cs336_spring2026_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf](./cs336_spring2026_assignment5_supplement_safety_rlhf.pdf)

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

As in previous assignments, we use `uv` to manage dependencies.

1. Install all packages except `flash-attn`, then all packages (`flash-attn` is weird)
```
uv sync --no-install-package flash-attn
uv sync
```

2. Run the required unit tests:

``` sh
uv run pytest tests/test_grpo.py
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
